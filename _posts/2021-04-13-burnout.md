[Burn-out](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/burnout) is an all-too-common affliction, leaving many people exhausted, cynical, unmotivated and unable to work. Pandemic lockdowns have done nothing to help the situation.

It often strikes as a result of chronic stress and overwork. People who are highly-engaged but poorly-supported, unable to relax, or lacking certain skills are at especially high risk, according to a [study](https://hbr.org/2018/02/1-in-5-highly-engaged-employees-is-at-risk-of-burnout)

In my experience, people suffering from burn-out are often the least able to address it, for the same reasons they are burning out in the first place -- even when the actions they can take may seem obvious.

What can be done to help someone suffering from burn-out?

## Hold up the mirror

Often our role is to hold up the mirror of reality. Show them what is happening.

- Your concern for how they appear to be affected 

- Your observations about how their work is impacted lately

- Feedback and concern from their colleagues

**This must be done with utmost empathy.** The goal is to support the person, so that they can get better --  not to criticise them, or make them feel small.

## Get them some headspace

Offering time off is a logical first step to help them get some breathing room so that a longer-term plan can be put in place.

A vacation would be ideal; or even better, if the person can take sick leave

- Where they can relax (ask them to picture a relaxing place)

- Do something they love (something where they can go into a ‘flow’ state and lose track of time)

- Spend time with family, friends and loved ones

- Do something different that breaks their routine for a bit

Any kind of time off is better than nothing. It is a mistake for them to avoid taking a holiday because they cannot travel, for example.

You will need to work with the person to ensure their responsibilities can be covered as well as possible while they are away -- and who knows how long that may be.

This is just buying time, though, and something must change; otherwise, the person will be back in the same situation before long.

## Longer-term plan

Work with the person to identify and develop skills that will help them cope better in the demanding modern-day work environment.

I recommend involving a medical professional such as a doctor or psychologist. For example, maybe your firm has a company doctor.

Work with the person to help teach them skills that can protect them going forwards. They can also work with an independent coach, which can be useful if there are struggles outside of the person’s professional life, too.

## Skills for success

Skills where you can coach the person include:

- **Focus**. Try to reduce the person’s scope as much as possible. Their work should reflect their critical responsibilities.
- **Time management**. Work with the person to schedule reduced work hours, that gradually increase over time. Help them clarify what they want to achieve in those limited hours.
- **Delegation**. Help the person insist on the help they need from others. What are they doing that others are better positioned to do?
- **Prioritisation**. The one or two things that the person needs to achieve should be crystal clear to you both.
- **Saying no**. All the above means that sometimes, the person will have to say no. Some people are extremely uncomfortable doing this. Let them know that you support them, and during this time, they can refer such queries to you.

## Health over performance 

When someone is burnt out, the important thing is their health and well-being. You as their manager will need to ensure their responsibilities are covered, because they may be unable to do so. The person’s performance at work is secondary to their long-term health -- even if they may not see it that way right now.

> One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important. -- Bertrand Russel

## Reflection on your part

Ultimately, not all people are suited for all roles, and vice versa. Anyone in a management position who struggles with the skills mentioned above is at serious risk of burnout, in my view.

I’ve seen cases where the company was at fault, by making a decision to put someone in a position that they were not equipped to handle. This jeopardises not only the company’s goals, but someone’s health and well-being.

So now is a good time to think about what decisions may have contributed to the current situation.

## Conclusion

Burn-out affects many people, including too-performers and people who are highly-engaged. They are often least able to help themselves. Get them some headspace, making sure their responsibilities are covered, and then work with them to put a longer-term plan in place. This can include medical assistance, reduced  work hours and responsibility, and coaching critical skills, such as: prioritisation, time management, delegation and saying no. It’s also a good time to reflect on anything the business many have done to contribute the situation.
