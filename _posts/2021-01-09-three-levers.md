## Getting 2021 started on the right foot

*Each week, we'll be looking at different tools to get ourselves into shape for the new year.*
*I'll be sharing some of my favourite techniques, that have worked well for me and others in the pastr.*
*In this first part of the series, we'll look at 3 straight-forward actions you can take to put a lagging project back-on-track.*

## Three levers you can pull when your project falls behind

**So your project that was supposed to be finished in 2020 has spilled over to 2021**.

The initial estimates were way off. The project plan didn't include time for testing or deployment.
The external team bailed on their commitments. The customers changed their requirements.
Whatever the reason, the elements have conspired to put your project behind schedule.
We've all been there. 
None of us wants a project that was supposed to be finished in 2020, continuing too long into 2021.
Tying up our past commitments from the last year with a nice bow is a practical step we can take to give ourselves the clean slate we deserve, and put ourselves into a forward-looking mindset for the new year.

**How can you put a project back on course?**

When I hear that a project is falling behind schedule, there are three 'levers' or courses of action that I consider first. Pulling these levers can help the project course-correct and get back on track. 

## The 3 levers

* **Time**: The project deadline, which is usually, but not always, fixed
* **Scope**: What is to be delivered by the project; e.g. features or functionality
* **Resources**: Ways in which money can be spent to 'accelerate' the project; e.g. adding people, purchasing software, hiring a consultant.

These three levers are intertwined.
Whenever you are considering one of these options, you should also consider the others.
An action plan to get the project back on track has the best chance of success if each of these factors is considered.

I'll expand on each of these below.

## Time

The project's deadline is normally fixed and adjusting it is normally not an option.
However, sometimes project deadlines can be flexible.
It can be wise to first find out what is the criticality of the deadline, from where does it originate and which stakeholders are dependent upon completion at the original deadline.
Sometimes, deadlines are set internally as a sort of motivational tool, or it really means 'as soon as possible' but there is no
real external stakeholder coordination around the end date.
In these cases, you may well have some negotiating leverage, if you are able to assemble a convincing business case based on data,
explaining what the obstacles thus far have been, how it is okay that this project can take longer than anticipated, what has been
prioritised instead of this project and why it was more important, and especially, what you will do with the additional time to
ensure that the project will then be delivered with certainty.
This is a trick you can only ever pull once at most on a given project; no one appreciates poor planning and unpredictable timelines.

It's important to raise any risk to the project timeline as soon as it is known to be a genuine problem.
Stakeholders should be kept aware of such risks.
To best inform your stakeholders and maintain trust, the best data you can provide is a highly-summarised description, statement or quantitative indication describing where the project should be by now versus where it is.
Everyone appreciates being informed of potential issues with their project as soon as possible, especially if there is a risk of blowing the deadline.

If you've committed to the deadline or you already know that the deadline cannot be adjusted then you should highlight the of course you should only request an extension as a last resort.

Don't request an extension if you already know that it will damage trust or your relationship with the stakeholder.

On the other hand, if it turns out that the deadline is flexible, then this is an easy win.

It's likely that the deadline is based on non-negotiable real-world factors.
In this case, the lever is 'fixed' and you will need to look towards the other levers, which is the point of this article.
It's always worthwhile to see if there is room for negotiation in the deadline. Now that we know that there isn't,
we can proceed to consider the two other useful levers.

## Scope

Reducing or 'shedding' scope from a project is the first step that you can consider take if it is falling behind.

This can mean deferring the work until later, carving the projects into parts for different teams

It is more important to deliver something that is minimally-viable rather than something that is perfectly complete; that's what is meant by minimally-viable product.

You should work with your stakeholders to help them identify what is absolutely critical to project success, versus what can be deferred until later, added in the next iteration or tackled as a separatee project.

In many cases, your key stakeholders will understand the need to prioritise the most critical work in order to deliver something viable at the project's end. In any case, they will likely understand that they will be providing feedback on the first iteration of the project, and that further iterations are already planned based on this feedback anyway. In other words, perhaps it suits them to first evaluate the initial version of the project, before a lot of effort is invested in building on it before the basics have been validated.

This is where it's very important to focus on the functionality which is most important to the customer, rather than implementing non-essential 'cool ideas' from the development team, for example. The team should be made to understand that there isn't time to even implement the original specification let alone additional 'nice-to-haves' that the team may think is important. This is what's meant by customer-first.

The following triangle helps to illustrate what is meant by a minimum-viable product:

The basic functionality exists end-to-end and can be tested for feedback and further iterations.

There are two techniques that are highly valuable when it comes to defining minimum-viable products and prioritising work for a project.

### Prioritising user stories

The first is to group user stories and other team tasks into priority levels, such as P1, P2 and so. It should be clear to the team and the stakeholders what work is prioritised as P1, what the criteria for that are and how the team should tackle it (e.g. before all other work except outages).
The team should understand that this work takes precedence over any other work on the backlog or other incoming external requests. This will help the team focus and apply its capacity to actually get this work through the door.
Even though they may not like the lack of flexibility in a pinch, they will certainly like it when the project is successfully completed and the customers are happy. They should understand that the situation may be temporary.
And of course, they should be rewarded appropriately once the work is done.

### Segmenting the project into stages or phases

The second technique is to organise the project into stages or phases: What is included at stage 1? What is included at stage 2? And to be very explicit about the functionality that will be delivered at each of these 'stage' milestones. This will help your teams and stakeholders formulate a 'big-picture' vision of the project, where they can start to understand what will be delivered at each phase of the project and way. In my experience, organising a project this way really helps everyone to get on the same and easily discuss major milestones which otherwise may be quite wordy or difficult to communicate without long documents.

Another benefit of this approach is the ease at which progress can be measured; you can see what phase the project is at as well as how much of each phase has been completed.

But this approach will only work for small-to-medium size projects; at an enterprise scale, for example, or a project where there are multiple teams involved, a more sophisticated project management system will be needed (roadmaps and so forth).

## Resources

The other lever that can be pulled is to invest further resources into the project.

For example, people could be added to the project, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions could be purchased rather than developed, or superior tools could be purchased.

### Adding people

There is an old saying in softare development that adding people to a late project makes it later. The reason is because the new people need to be brought up to speed. When the original project team is already struggling with their workload and pushing to meet deadlines, bringing new staff members up-to-speed can drain them and take their time away from the project, as well as resulting in a poor experience for the new joiners who may perceive the environment as chaotic.

The key consideration when adding people is this: **Does the existing project team even have the capacity to bring a new joiner up-to-speed at this point?**

If the project is overseen by a project manager, the question is also: **Does the current project manager realistically have the capacity to manage one additional worker?**

You can see how adding people to a late project can make it later, especially if the team is already stretched.

Even experienced developers joining the project will need to learn the basics of the business domain, get orientated into the project and its goals, learn the development practices for the project and meet everybody. If projects run on a relatively standardised platform (similar tooling, similar expectations from participants, standard programming languages, frameworks, development methodology and agile practices), then the onboarding time can be greatly reduced -- but not eliminated. And to repeat, this applies even when bringing in an expert.


#### Structure project for parallel work

The structure of the project and software development practices of the team need to allow for additional people to be added.

In order for development capacity to scale proportionally to the number of developers added, the work needs to be broken down into sensible chunks that can be implemented by different people simultaneously.

This is one reason why it's so important to plan projects thoughtfully upfront and break large tasks down into smaller pieces.

#### Identify and remove bottlenecks

Adding people won't accelerate the project if there is some other bottleneck.
For example, consider the case where input from a star developer, is needed for progress to happen on any piece of the project. If this person is already struggling with time management, they
may have few opportunities to interact with new joiners and onboard them to their tasks.

This is one reason why it's important to always maintain a bus factor greater than one;
there should be several people sufficiently familiar with the project to keep it on track.

You can challenge your team to bring multiple people up-to-speed with the project so that
they can mutually support each other and remove single points-of-failure (SPOFs).

### Purchasing solutions or commerical services

It may be the case that a significant part of the project already exists and can be purchased as a commerical project.
For example, when working on Booking's internal customer software, we consistently evaluated solutions such as Jira, Zendesk or Swimlanes rather than creating internal proprietary software.

Many times, an open source solution is available, which can be 'upgraded' to a commercial tier
of support. At Amazon, managing complex trees of MySQL database was a major challenge,
which was ultimately overcome by purchasing a commercial solution called Percona that effectively
upgraded many of the automated tools and best practices that were already being used.

If a major requirement of the project can be fulfilled simply through a purchase or subscription
which is reasonably-priced relative to the cost of development and ongoing maintenance,
then it can drastically simplify the project.

So it's worth it to check and to challenge your team if you believe they are suffering from Fear of Not-Invented-Here (NIH) syndrome.

### Hiring experts

There is a saying in software development that 1 good engineer can be hundreds of times more effective than a mediocre one.

Some projects can benefit from the input of a specialist if they are trying to solve a problem in a particular domain.
For example, at Booking, bringing in a senior developer with experience in creating services greatly accelerated the creation of services, and this person is effectively helping different
teams get their services up-and-running, seeding these teams with their knowledge at the same time,
so that they are empowered to own these services going forward.
We can see in each instance that having such an expert is key to success.

Even experts will still need to get up to speed on the project though, which is why it's important to document everything and prevent the team from ever getting too stretched to onboard new people in the first place.
