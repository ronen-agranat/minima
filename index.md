## Welcome to my website!

I'm a **software development manager** at **Booking.com** in Amsterdam, owning the property page on the core funnel. Previously, I worked at **Amazon EC2** in Cape Town. *All views expressed are my own.*

Here you can find blog posts based on my professional management experience.
Topics include:

* People and project management
* Engineering and technical leadership
* Software architecture

My goal is to share knowledge and help other aspiring engineering leaders.

I previously worked at Amazon EC2 and have a BSc(Eng) in electrical and computer engineering.
