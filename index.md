## Welcome to my blog

My name is Ronen Agranat.
I write blog posts based on my personal experience as a software development manager. Topics I cover include people and project management, engineering leadership, agile and software architecture.
My goal is to share knowledge and help other aspiring leaders.

I work at Booking.com in Amsterdam, where I lead an organisation of 25 people in all kinds of roles, including team leads and other managers, developers, designers, copywriters, data and machine learning scientists, and quality specialists.
