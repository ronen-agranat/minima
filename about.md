Welcome to my website, where I share information based on my experience as a software development engineering manager.

### A little bit about me

Somehow, I manage. My middle name means 'bear'. I can lick my elbow. Kick me and support the nerd foundation.

I worked at Amazon EC2 in Cape Town at the height of the cloud-computing boom.
Now I work at Booking.com in Amsterdam.
Along the way, I've run my own company, worked at various start-ups and scale-ups, and made apps and websites of my own.
